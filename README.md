# Parallel-image-processing
Progarmming language - Java

This project uses Java Fork Join framework to apply the divide and conquer technique to generate the new image.
Java 8 Stream APIs are used for serial and parallel computation in the intermediate steps. 
It generates a black and white image and another image with high brightness values for a given image.
The two test files are used to run Junit tests to compute the efficiency of the parallel version and serial version of the image generation algorithm.
